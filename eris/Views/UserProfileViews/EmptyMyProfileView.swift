        Text("Looks Like you don't have any Boujees right now! This means none of your followers (yet) have posted a Boujee for you. On our app BOUJÃˆ, you can \"Boujee\" your followers, meaning you can post a Boujee (post) for them, but never yourself. The idea is to create a place not of self-expression, but rather self-reflection. Your profile is a product of everything your followers do with it. And the same goes for for all your followers too :) ")
